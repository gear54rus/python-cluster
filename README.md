Python cluster
==============

An attempt to make software package which will be able to execute tasks described in Python in parallel.

This software consists of cluster node and cluster owner. 
Owner is written in C++/QT and also requires Python interpreter to execute tasks locally.
Node is written in Python.

Also, there is a repository which aims to produce [node for Android](https://github.com/Gorefistus/Android-node-for-python-cluster).
